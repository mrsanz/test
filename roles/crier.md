## Tasks

***A week before, ideally towards the beginning of the week***

- [ ] Draft a message
- [ ] Email prior attendees the message reminding them of the upcoming meeting
- [ ] Personally invite new attendees sharing the reason why you think they'd be a good addition 

***Day Prior to the event***
- [ ] Draft a message
- [ ] Send out a reminder all potential attendees (new and old) 

***Tips***

* Remind folks of any updates that are helpful to do ahead of time, e.g. filling out a form or updating a portion of the agenda.

* Be as concise as possible in your messaging.  Adding things like emoji's or other non essential elements in your communication can annoy if it is over the top.
